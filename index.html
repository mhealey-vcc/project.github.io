    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The thirteenth amendment of the United States Constitution was created to completely abolish slavery. It was passed by Abraham Lincoln following the Union’s victory in the Civil War, though it did not pass without initial Congressional resistance. This page will give an overview about the amendment’s stages of progression, from its conception to its ratification.</p>

    <h2>The Civil War</h2>
    <p>Prior to the amendment’s formal ratification, the dissonance between the northern and southern states brewed until a boiling point was reached. This resulted in the secession of the majority of southern states to form the Confederacy. Consequently, the northern states formed the Union, thus setting the stage for the Civil War. The National Park Service details the direct events that lead to formal action among the states. Before president Abraham Lincoln was formally inaugurated, South Carolina chose to secede from the Union, which was followed by the rest of the southern states in roughly two months (nps.gov.) Much of the dissonance between the Union and the Confederacy was a result of disagreement between the two entities regarding whether slavery should be allowed to remain legal or not. The Union largely wished to abolish slavery, whereas the Confederacy wanted it to remain legal. The Civil War formally began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Around two years and many battlefields later, the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect on January 1, 1863. As is stated by the National Park Service, “The Emancipation Proclamation was a war measure that declared enslaved people in rebelling states to be free, authorized the enlistment of black troops, and outraged white Southerners. The proclamation was an important turning point in the war for the United States and in the eventual shift from the goal of restoring the Union as it was, to building a better Union without slavery,” (nps.gov.) This was the original framework for the Thirteenth Amendment, and it further stoked the proverbial flames of war between the Confederacy and the Union. This was followed by many more battles between the North and South, until the Confederacy officially surrendered at the battle of Appomattox Courthouse on April 9, 1865 (battlefields.org.) </p>
    <h2>Official Ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment</h2>
    <p>The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the American Civil War. As the war neared its end, President Abraham Lincoln and the Union government recognized the necessity of formally abolishing slavery to ensure a lasting and comprehensive victory. As is detailed in both the National Archives and the Library of Congress, though the Civil War had not yet ended, the process of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment began with its proposal in Congress on January 31, 1865. The proposed amendment passed the Senate on April 8, 1864, and the House of Representatives on January 31, 1865 (loc.gov.) The verbiage of the amendment was both direct and concise, stating, "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction," (archives.gov.) To officially become law, the amendment required approval from three quarters of the states. By December 6, 1865, the necessary number of states had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, officially abolishing slavery in the United States. The ratification process was expedited by the Union's military success on multiple battlefields towards the end of the Civil War, as well as Confederate states rejoining the Union, which sought to comply with the new legislative landscape. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment marked a pivotal moment in the United States’ history. It’s creation and ratification symbolized both the end of slavery, as well as setting the stage for a new United States of America, where future Constitutional amendments and legislation could be created with the hopes of securing civil rights and equality for every US citizen.</p>
