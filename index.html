    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Regarding “Revolutionary Road,” by Richard Yates, I am both intrigued and slightly dismayed at its progression thus far. It seemingly exemplifies the stereotypical “perfect 50s family” that Frank and April are both living, when in reality neither one of them is happy with their circumstances. Their relationship has gone from love, romance, and happiness to one of disdain and eventually debauchery by Frank. It is a bit sad to read how both of them are slowly realizing that their relationship is at a very precarious point of potential destruction, which neither can avoid. This mentality eventually leads April to propose a move to Paris, where she believes that Frank can have time to figure out what it is that he truly desires to do rather than continue working at Knox, a job he despises, while she makes the money. Even after the two agree on this, the element of uncertainty remains. I have only visited New York City once, and I did not experience “suburban New York,” but what did seem relevant to my upbringing was a suburban household where both parents were at odds with each other. I would call this aspect extremely unfortunately familiar, as it almost tells a parallel tale to what my parents likely thought while watching their own relationship fall apart. This faux display of the perfect nuclear family struck very close to home for me as a result. Regardless, the book so far is uncharacteristically accurate of what many couples likely experience, as well as the perceived need to maintain the lie towards their children and act like nothing is wrong, which is both fascinating and depressing.</p>
